bh_learn_more_str_1="genie detected that you are trying to install your new NETGEAR router behind another gateway, for example, the DSL or cable gateway from your Internet service provider. Usually a gateway also provides WiFi or Voice over Internet (VoIP) function. You can install your NETGEAR router in two different operation modes."
bh_learn_more_str_2="This mode configures your new NETGEAR router as a normal WiFi router behind your gateway and creates a separate network behind your gateway. To take full advantage of these router's advanced funcstions, NETGEAR recommends that you use router mode. In router mode, the only device that can be connetcted to your existing gateway is your new NETGEAR router. You must connect all of your devices to the new NETGEAR router. If your existing gateway has a WiFi function, disable it."
bh_learn_more_str_3_1="Access Point"
bh_learn_more_str_3_2="If you want ot use the new router to get better WiFi performance beyond what you have with your existing gateway, access point mode is the easiest way to do that. NETGEAR recommends that you disable the WiFi function on your existing gwateway, if it has WiFi functionality. With this mode, you can connet wired devices to the gateway and connect wired and WiFi devices to your new NETGEAR router."
bh_learn_more_str_4="In this mode, by default, the new router's IP address is assigned by your gateway dynamically and is unlikely to be 192.168.1.1. However, you can still use the URL <a href='http://www.routerlogin.net' target='_blank'>http://www.routerlogin.net</a> to access the router's management GUI from a device connected to the router. Some <a href='router_function.html' target='_blank'>router functions</a> are not available in this mode, and you must use router mode if you want to use those functions."

If you have a device like a web server at home that others access remotely using a host name that you registered (usually through a dynamic DNS service) or using an IP address, you probably have the port forwarding function enabled. If you have never heard of this function, even if you have remote access to a device at home, It's likely you don't use this function."
