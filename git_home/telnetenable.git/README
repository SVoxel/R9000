telnetenable

This is a tool for activating the listening mode of the telnet console
on some Netgear routers. For more information, please refer to
  http://wiki.openwrt.org/OpenWrtDocs/Hardware/Netgear/TelnetConsole

Please read the telnetenable.c header for additional information on 
copyright and licensing terms.

Please note that this tool is currently lacking a socket layer
implementation, and is therefore only usable to craft individual magic
packets, but not to send them to the router.

To compile, use
  gcc -o telnetenable telnetenable.c md5.c Blowfish.c

To run it, pass the same parameters as you would pass to the original 
tool (telnetEnable.exe by Netgear) upon command line invocation. You
can see the usage by simply running
  ./telnetenable

Please note that this software is completely unsupported. 

An updated version providing a network layer implementation may or may 
not be provided in the future. If you would like to contribute any 
patches or have crafted modified versions (you are welcome to do so
under the terms of the GPL!), we would appreciate a hint.

touch for reasons other than usage support, please contact both of us.
