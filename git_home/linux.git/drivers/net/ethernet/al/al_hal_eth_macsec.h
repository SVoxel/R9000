/*******************************************************************************
This file defines the API for MAC Security protocol (MacSec), which provides
the possibility to maintain a secured L2 or overlay (tunnel) link, at line rate
bandwidth (10Gbps).
The advanced Ethernet Controller in Alpine Platform-on-Chip, implementes an
inline MacSec accelerator, which enables each Tx/Rx pkt to be
encrypted/decrypted and signed/authenticated, as defined in IEEE 802.1AE, as
well as in novel extensions, enabling inline AES-GCM-GMAC on alternative payload
inluding L3 or passenger tunnels.
The MacSec engine is designed to provide L2 security, with minimum SW changes,
in order to help the user achieve maximum performance & security, with minimum
overhead.  The engine supports AES-128, AES-192 and AES-256 encryption, and
could be configured for Authentication-mode only or full data protection that
provides encryption and authentication.


Terminology:
=================
1. SA - Security Association. A set of cryptographic parameters needed to secure
	the traffic (such as key, initialization-vector, packet-number, etc).
	For improved performance, SAs are stored in an internal scratch-pad
	memory named SAD (Security Association Data-Structure).
	Each SAD entry stores a single SA.
2. SC - Secured Channel. A point-to-point secured link.
	Each SC comprises a succession of up to 4 SAs, which are indexed by a
	two-bit integer called AN (Association Number).
	Each TX MacSec packet is given a SC-index and an AN, from which the
	relevant SA index is constructed.
3. Association Number - index of currently used SA in the Secured Channel (used
			for hot swap).
4. Hot Swap - Switching SAs (key, IV, etc) in runtime.
	Hot-Swap is supported by pre-loading up-to 4 SAs per SC, and using the
	AN to switch between SAs in runtime.
	+ TX side:	The transmitter is responsible for initiating hot-swap.
			Once the TX packet-number reaches a pre-configured
			threshold, an IRQ is raised, signaling the upper layer
			to switch keys. This is performed by simply incrementing
			the AN of the next packets to be transmitted.
			Note: AN is encoded in the  MacSec SECTAG header.
	+ RX side:	The receiver acts as slave in the hot-swap mechanism. It
			receives the SC & AN indication from the SECTAG header,
			and thus when the transmitter performs hot-swap
			(increments AN), the receiver immediately follows.
5. SAD - Security Association Data-Structure, scratch-pad memory for storing SAs.
	 TX-SAD & RX-SAD are always written in pairs, and maintained by the HW.
	 Maintanance includes incrementing of PN value (Packet-Number).
	 + TX side: next PN to be coded in MacSec header
	 + RX side: next expected PN (used for replay attack protection)

	 AN SAD can store up to 128 SAs (== SAD entries).
	 In common usage (i.e. sad_access_mode=0, num_an_per_sc=0),  SAD will
	 be organized as follows:
	 =================================================
	            |  SA_INDEX  |   SC_INDEX  |  AN   |
	            ====================================

	 =================================================


Common Usage:
=================

1. Initialization stage
	initialization should be performed by by the the main driver, and in
	case of IO Virtualization/SRIOV, the MacSec engine must be initialized
	by the PF driver (vs. the VF driver)
	During initialization, user must make sure that no traffic is sent/received.
	--------------------------
	+ common usage example:
	--------------------------
		al_eth_macsec_init (adapter, 0, 0, 0xFF000000, 1);

2. Loading crypto parameters
	MacSec engine contains a scratch-pad memory, called SAD, for storing
	cryptographic parameters (SAs) of each Secured Channel.
	SAD should be updated periodically by the PF, according to an upper-
	layer protocl such as 802.1AF.
	--------------------------
	+ common usage example:
	--------------------------
		struct al_eth_macsec_sa sa =  {
			.valid				=  1,
			.key_size			= AL_ETH_KEY_SIZE_128,
			.key				= <ptr_prepared_key>,

			.iv				= <ptr_prepared_iv>,
			.sci				= <ptr_prepared_sci>,
			.pn_rx				= <prepared rx pn>,
			.pn_tx				= <prepared tx pn>,
			.signature_size 		= 16,

			.replay_offload_en		=  1,
			.macsec_encapsulation_en	=  1,
			.sectag_tci_end_station		=  0,
			.sectag_tci_encode_sci		=  1,
			.sectag_offset			= 12
		};
		al_eth_macsec_sad_entry_write (adapter, &sa, <some sad index>);
		al_eth_macsec_sc_map_entry_write (adapter, sa.sci, sci_mask, <some sc index>);
		// sc_index should be construct as sad_index >> 1/2 (depending on number of AN/SC)


	* NOTE1:  index should be constructed as follows
		  (2 options, dependent on initialization):
		    + option #1: 5-bit secured channel, 2-bit association number
		    + option #2: 6-bit secured_channel, 1-bit association number
	* NOTE2:  in common usage, each VF receives 32 dedicated SA entries.
		  in such a case, the relevant offset (VF ID x 32) should be
		  added to index when calling al_eth_macsec_sad_entry_write.

3. Sending macsec packets is performed independently by the VFs.
	--------------------------
	+ common usage example:
	--------------------------
		struct al_eth_pkt pkt {
		...
		.macsec_secure_channel	   = <relevant secure channel idx>,
		.macsec_association_number = <relevant association number>,
		.macsec_flags              = 7  // encrypt & sign pkt flags
		// for further details regarding macsec_flags, see:
		// AL_ETH_MACSEC_TX_FLAGS_* and AL_ETH_MACSEC_RX_FLAGS_*
		...
		};
		pkt.flags |= AL_ETH_TX_FLAGS_L2_MACSEC_PKT;  // pkt is macsec-pkt
		pkt.macsec_flags = AL_ETH_MACSEC_TX_FLAGS_SIGN; // pkt should be signed

		pkt.macsec_secure_channel = <secure channel>;
		pkt.macsec_association_number = <association number>;
		al_eth_tx_pkt_prepare(tx_dma_q, &pkt);

4. Receiving macsec packets is performed independetly by the VFs.
	--------------------------
	+ common usage example:
	--------------------------
	// ... code for receiving a pkt:... //

	// checking if packet is macsec:
	al_bool is_macsec_pkt = pkt.macsec_flags & AL_ETH_MACSEC_RX_FLAGS_IS_MACSEC;

	// checking for authentication success:
	al_bool is_auth_sucess = is_macsec_pkt &
				(pkt.macsec_flags & AL_ETH_MACSEC_RX_FLAGS_AUTH_SUCCESS);
