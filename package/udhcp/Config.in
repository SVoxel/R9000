	  In RFC2131, Page.9-10,
	  ...
	  The 'options' field is now variable length. A DHCP client must be
	  prepared to receive DHCP messages with an 'options' field of at least
	  length 312 octets.  This requirement implies that a DHCP client must
	  be prepared to receive a message of up to 576 octets, the minimum IP
	  datagram size an IP host must be prepared to accept [3].  ...
	  ...

	  Some DHCP server will send a packet larger than 576 octets(which include IP,
	  UDP header, not include Ethernet header), but the 'struct udp_dhcp_packet'
	  size is 576 in udhcp code. If we simple enlarge the option buffer size, the
	  packet which is larger than 576 octets can be received. It seems fixed this
	  bugs, but cause another defect, that the dhcp packets which router send are
	  larger than 576 octets also, which makes many DHCP server can't handle the
	  larger DHCP packet and lead to DHCP process fail if using DHCP type to get
	  WAN IP.

	  Consider the packet size of almost all of DHCP packet Router send is less
	  than 576 octets, so we can dynamic resize the DHCP packet according to it's
	  real payload size and make sure their size are not larger than 576 octets
	  before send out.
