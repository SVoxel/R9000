/**
 * Address mapping:
 * Read and write requests are provided to the DDR controller with a system
 * address.  The system address is the command address of a transaction as
 * presented on one of the data ports. The DDR controller is responsible for
 * mapping this system address to rank, bank, row, and column addresses to the
 * SDRAM. It converts the system address to a physical address.
 * For each CS/bank/column/row bit assign a system memory address bit index.
 * Set to AL_DDR_ADDRMAP_NC if not connected.
 * CS minimal supported memory address bit index is 10.
 * Bank minimal supported memory address bit index is 6.
 * Column minimal supported memory address bit index is 4.
 * Row minimal supported memory address bit index is 10.
 *
 * Address mapping might affect the system performance and should be optimized
 * according to the specific application nature. The basic guideline is keeping
 * as much open pages as possible and avoiding frequent closing of pages and
 * opening new ones.
 *
 * Example:
 * Mapping of 16GB memory device with 64 bits data width, 1KB page
 *
 * System address bit index |	SDRAM required mapping
 * ----------------------------------------------------
 * 33:32			cs[1:0]
 * 31:16			row[15:0]
 * 15:13			bank[2:0]
 * 12:3				col[9:0]
 * 2:0				N/A since 8 bytes are accessed at a time
 *
 * In this case the following setting is required:
 * col_b3_9_b11_13 = { 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, AL_DDR_ADDRMAP_NC, ... }
 * bank_b0_2 = { 13, 14, 15 }
 * row_b0_2_10 = { 16, 17, 18 }
 * row_b11_15 = { 27, 28, 29, 30, 31 }
 * cs_b0_1 = { 32, 33 }
