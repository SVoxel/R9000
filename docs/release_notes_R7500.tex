%% \begin{abstract}
%%   \noindent Large delay schedulable regions, work-conserving property,
%%   inter-session protection property, and acceptable realization
%%   complexity are widely accepted performance metrics for
%%   comparing packet
%%   scheduling disciplines in packet-switching networks. % Under
%% %  continuous-time assumptions, it is a difficult task to design a
%% %  scheduling discipline with all these advantages.
%%   In this paper, we propose a \emph{work-conserving} scheduling
%%   discipline, called \ispnpedf, with \emph{optimal} delay schedulable
%%   regions, and inter-session protection property. In addition,
%%   the realization complexity of \ispnpedf\ is lower than that of
%%   plain EDF (Earliest-Deadline First) with traffic regulators.
