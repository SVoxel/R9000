			DNI Linux Kernel proc entries

This document records all proc entry interface about DNI Linux Kernel.
Project Leader should reference this document to enable or disable features add by DNI.


/proc/sys/net/dni/dod_skip_control_packet

    Symptom:
	When PPP dial on demand, ppp will skip control packets by:
	# echo "1" > /proc/sys/net/dni/dod_skip_control_packet

    Default:
	PPP works as original Linux code by:
	# echo "0" > /proc/sys/net/dni/dod_skip_control_packet

/proc/sys/net/ipv4/bridge_max_fdb_entry

    This new version adds Atheros's patch (received at Oct 7 07:52 2009)
    along with proc interface is also added. In order to enable this new
    feature, use the following command to set max number of bridge fdb
    entries:

    Symptom:
	echo "1024" > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/bridge_max_fdb_entry
	Then maybe run
	# cat /proc/sys/net/ipv4/bridge_max_fdb_entry
	to verify the set value.

    Default:
	If not set,
	# cat /proc/sys/net/ipv4/bridge_max_fdb_entry
	show 0, which means there is no upper limit on the number of bridge fdb
	entries.


/proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_option_rr_ssrr_lsrr_pass_through

    Symptom:
	    For IP options Record Route (7), Strict Source Route (9),
	    and Loose Source Route (3) pass through without changing anything by:
	    # echo "1" > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_option_rr_ssrr_lsrr_pass_through

    Default:
	    IP options works as normal Linux code by:
	    # echo "0" > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_option_rr_ssrr_lsrr_pass_through


/proc/sys/net/ipv4/ipfrag_overlap_drop

    Symptom:
	    Dropping detecting of these attack packets can be enabled by:
	    # echo "1" > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ipfrag_overlap_drop

    Default:
	    Dropping detecting of these attack packets can be disabled by:
	    # echo "0" > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ipfrag_overlap_drop


/proc/sys/net/ipv4/udp_ssdp_deliver_all

    Symptom:
            Sending SSDP UDP port 1900 packets to all UPnP related sockets, for
	    miniupnpd and wps share the same binding port 1900 by:
	    # echo "1" > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/udp_ssdp_deliver_all

    Default:
	    UDP port 1900 works as normal Linux code by:
	    # echo "0" > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/udp_ssdp_deliver_all
