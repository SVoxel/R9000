Currently transmission overwrites the settings.json configuration file
on exit. The daemon can be instructed to reload the config with a SIGHUP,
or
 # invoke-rc.d transmission-daemon reload

Otherwise changes made manually to the file while the daemon is running 
will be silently overwritten on exit.
