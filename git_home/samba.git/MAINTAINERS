## List of current Samba Maintainers 
##

This file contains a list of developers responsible for 
portions of the Samba 3.0 code.  It also lists developers
responsible for 3rd party projects that work with Samba
(e.g. vfs modules).

Note that this list is for you benefit, but please do not
abuse it by constantly emailing a stream of help questions
to the maintainers.  Some are more open to direct 
communication than others and some struggle with enormous
amounts of email every day.

All bug reports for code that is maintained *within* the 
Samba subversion tree should be filed at https://bugzilla.samba.org/.
