/* BB_AUDIT SUSv3 compliant -- unless configured as fancy echo. */

/* Mar 16, 2003      Manuel Novoa III   (mjn3@codepoet.org)
 *
 * Because of behavioral differences, implemented configurable SUSv3
 * or 'fancy' gnu-ish behaviors.  Also, reduced size and fixed bugs.
 * 1) In handling '\c' escape, the previous version only suppressed the
 *     trailing newline.  SUSv3 specifies _no_ output after '\c'.
 * 2) SUSv3 specifies that octal escapes are of the form \0{#{#{#}}}.
 *    The previous version version did not allow 4-digit octals.
