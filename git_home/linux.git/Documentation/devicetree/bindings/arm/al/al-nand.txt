Annapurna Labs NAND controller

Required properties:
  - compatible : should be "annapurna-labs,al-nand"
  - reg : Offset and length of the nand base.
  - interrupts : The interrupt number.

Optional properties:
  - #address-cells : required when using partitions and should be set to <1>
  - #size-cells : required when using partitions and should be set to <1>

  The device tree may optionally contain sub-nodes describing partitions of the
  address space. See partition.txt for more detail.

Examples:

nand-flash {
	compatible = "annapurna-labs,al-nand";
	reg = <0xfa100000 0x00202000>;
	interrupts = <0 1 4>;

	#address-cells = <1>;
	#size-cells = <1>;

	partition@0 {
		...
	};

};
