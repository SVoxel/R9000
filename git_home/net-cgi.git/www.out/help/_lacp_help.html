Disables the Ethernet port aggregation function on the router. Ethernet port 1 and port 2 can be used as independent Ethernet ports.<li>Dynamic (IEEE 802.3ad). The router communicates with the device connected to Ethernet port 1 and port 2 on the router, and checks if Ethernet port aggregation capability is supported on the device. <br>If Ethernet port aggregation capability is supported, the router automatically trunks Ethernet port 1 and port 2. If not, Ethernet port 1 and port 2 work as independent Ethernet ports. </li><li>Enable static LAG. Static LAG is part of port trunking technology. If your trunking device only can support static LAG, select this option; otherwise, NETGEAR would recommend you to select dynamic LACP instead. (Important Notice: You must enable static LAG mode before you connect your device to Ethernet port 1 and port 2 on the router.)</li></ul><p name=agg_status id=agg_status></p><p><b>Ethernet Port Aggregation Status</b><p><ul><li>Inactive.
