Annapurna Labs AHCI Controller

GPIOs used to expose the sata ports presence and activity.

Properties:
- compatible : Should contain "annapurna-labs,al-sata-sw-leds".

each led represents the GPIO used for each sata port, the port represented
by the AHCI pci address (domian, bus, dev), host 0 @ 00:00:08, and host 1
@ 00:00:09.
and the port number within that host.

sata_sw_leds {
	compatible = "annapurna-labs,al-sata-sw-leds";
	led@0 {
		label = "host 0, port 0 activity&presence led";
		pci_domain = <0>;
		pci_bus = <0>;
		pci_dev = <8>;
		port = <0>;
		gpios =<&gpio0 1 0>;
	};
	led@1 {
		label = "host 0, port 1 activity&presence led";
		pci_domain = <0>;
		pci_bus = <0>;
		pci_dev = <8>;
		port = <1>;
		gpios =<&gpio0 2 0>;
	};
};
